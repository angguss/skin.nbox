nbox
====

nbox is an official XBMC skin that has been forked from the (apparently) stagnant development of tree_jammer's lightbox skin. http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=128852

###Goals

I have recently made the switch from the Boxee Box to a Raspberry Pi running Raspbmc and want a beautiful skin that is as simple and beautiful to use as Boxee was. Tree_jammer's lightbox skin is gorgeous, but it needed some tweaking and fixing up as it is only in alpha in order to make it functional and responsive in a Raspberry Pi.

Unlike most other XBMC skins, nbox only has 1 view that can be turned into a list view in the skin settings. This is done to achieve a UI consistency and make it easy for the user to always know where to look for information.
